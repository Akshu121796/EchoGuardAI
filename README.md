🛡️ EchoGuard
India’s Real-time Emotionally Intelligent Misinformation Sentinel

EchoGuard is an autonomous Agentic AI system designed to detect, analyze, and neutralize misinformation before it goes viral.
Unlike traditional fact-checkers, EchoGuard understands the emotional triggers—fear, anger, and confusion—that accelerate the spread of misinformation, especially during crises.

EchoGuard operates in a fully automated Sense → Think → Act loop to protect digital ecosystems from panic, hostility, and false narratives.

🔥 Why EchoGuard?

During crises, misinformation spreads faster than facts because it rides on human emotions.
Conventional fact-checking systems only verify claims — they do not understand the psychology behind why misinformation explodes.

EchoGuard bridges this gap by blending:

✅ Real-time fact verification

🧠 Emotional intelligence (Fear / Anger / Confusion detection)

🤖 Autonomous agentic decision-making

Result: Emotion-aware, calming, and de-escalating responses delivered directly at the misinformation source.

🧠 Core Concept: Sense → Think → Act

EchoGuard continuously runs a three-stage autonomous loop:

🔍 SENSE

Monitors platforms like X (Twitter) in real time

Detects emerging misinformation using virality scoring

Connects to verified sources:

WHO

Reuters

PIB

Official government datasets

Tracks engagement signals to prioritize high-risk misinformation

🧠 THINK

Dual-layer intelligence engine:

✔ Fact Verification (RAG)

Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Pulls evidence from trusted, verified knowledge bases

✔ Emotion Analysis

Classifies content into emotional triggers:

Fear → Panic-driven narratives

Anger → Hostility, blame, rage

Confusion → Misinterpretation, lack of clarity

This enables EchoGuard to understand why misinformation is spreading — not just what is false.

⚡ ACT

EchoGuard responds autonomously with psychologically tailored messaging:
| Detected Emotion | Response Style                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Fear             | Calming, empathetic, reassuring + verified facts |
| Anger            | Firm, respectful, de-escalating                  |
| Confusion        | Clear, step-by-step explanations                 |

All responses are:

Factual

Concise

Designed to defuse emotional escalation
